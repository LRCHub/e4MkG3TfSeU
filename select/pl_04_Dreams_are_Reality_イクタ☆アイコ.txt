Always dreaming,but not
prophetic dreams
Just what I wanna come true...
Through that long dark tunnel
already
It's a beautiful,dazzling white
world
Why have I held onto memories of
the past?
'Cause they're important things
that won't fade away?
If it's a dream,don't wanna wake
Dreams are reality!
Then someday they are both the
same we'll surely believe
Waiting for the time to fade all
of my heartache away?
Forget that kind of time,Let's
focus on living now!
Always dreaming,but not
prophetic dreams
Just what I wanna come true...
The deeply built up sadness
melted by the tears
Surely I can go out now?
Why have I held onto memories of
the past?
'Cause they're important things
that won't fade away?
If it's a dream,don't wanna wake
Dreams are reality!
Then someday they are both the
same we'll surely believe
Waiting for the time to fade all
of my heartache away?
Forget that kind of time,Let's
focus on living now!
Dreams are reality!
We'll surely believe
Dreams are reality!
Let's focus on living now!!
living now...living now...
